Everything is subject to change, including repo name!

The end goal is to have language-agnostic support for adding useful comments to pieces of code. The main plugin (this repo) would expose useful functions for other plugins to provide language-specific comments.

The idea is to support adding basic text comments and [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) snippets.
Text comments:

With LuaSnip:

The current code has stuff that is useful for develompent and will be removed later (such as the Rust-specific functions).
